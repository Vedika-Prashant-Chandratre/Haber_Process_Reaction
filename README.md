# Haber_Process_Reaction

‚öóÔ∏è Haber Process Reaction ‚Äì C++ Chemical Animation

Developed by: Vedika Chandratre, Aditi Pawar, Anjali Pawar, Sharwari Kachole.

This project visually demonstrates the Haber Process (N‚ÇÇ + 3H‚ÇÇ ‚áå 2NH‚ÇÉ) using C++ graphics. It simulates the reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen gases forming ammonia through animated molecules, temperature, and pressure effects ‚Äî a creative fusion of chemistry and programming.

üß™ Features:

Animated visualization of the Haber Process reaction.

Developed using Turbo C++ graphics (BGI library).

Illustrates molecule movement, reaction equilibrium, and catalyst effect.

Educational project merging science and coding.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack:

Language: C++

Graphics Library: BGI (Turbo C++)
