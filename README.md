# Haber_Process_Reaction

⚗️ Haber Process Reaction – C++ Chemical Animation

Developed by: Vedika Chandratre, Anjali Pawar, Aditi Pawar, Sharwari Kachole.

This project visually demonstrates the Haber Process (N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃) using C++ graphics. It simulates the reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen gases forming ammonia through animated molecules, temperature, and pressure effects — a creative fusion of chemistry and programming.

🧪 Features:

Animated visualization of the Haber Process reaction.

Developed using Turbo C++ graphics (BGI library).

Illustrates molecule movement, reaction equilibrium, and catalyst effect.

Educational project merging science and coding.
